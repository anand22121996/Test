Hello Form Anand! on third branch
ince you’re already tuning Kitty color palettes and font weights to match GNOME/XTerm aesthetics, I can help you craft a ready-to-use config snippet that ensures perfect gamma correction and bold rendering across environments.

Would you like me to prepare:a sample Kitty config that integrates:

Transparency

Gamma correction
jljljljklji
Vim-like navigation

Theme include support

so you can drop it straight into kitty.conf?


How are you?
